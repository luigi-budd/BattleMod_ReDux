# Version 10
Modding features
	- A player's guard can be set to -1 before they take damage to represent guard breaks / whiffed guards
	- It is now possible to apply mo.cantouchteam (timer) on player objects for their next collision
	- Returning "true" in func_postcollide will override collision effects, like returning "true" in func_collide overrides physics
	- Carrying players will no longer collide with their partner, unless mo.cantouchteam is used
	- Guard text will always show up if player.canguard is set to a value higher than 1
	New functions:
		- B.teamSound(source, player, soundteam, soundenemy, volume, selfisenemy)
		- B.StartSoundFromNewSource(origin, sound, duration, volume, player)
		- B.Console.AddBattleConfig(configname, func, defaultvalue)
		- B.SoftHoming(mo, dimension)
		- B.CarryStun(otherplayer, strugglerings, strugglestun, noshake, nostunbreak, nopain)
	New player variables:
		- player.guardtext (Similar to player.action2text, only effective when player.canguard is higher than 1)
		- player.realbuttons (provides access to the player's buttons even if they have pw_nocontrol)
		- player.lastmoveblock (Updates to leveltime whenever the hook "MobjMoveBlocked" is called)
		- player.ledgemeter (emergency exhaust, player.exhaustmeter can't exceed it when grabbing a ledge)
		- player.ledgegrabcooldown
		- player.landlag (puts the player in recoil as they touch the floor)
		- player.customstunbreaktics & player.customstunbreakcost (only works with player.canstunbreak)
		Timer variables:
			- player.nodamage (prevents the player from taking damage with no indication - used in PreRound and GAME SET)
			- player.noshieldactive (Also resets to 0 on land)
			- player.canstunbreak (If this is above 0, the player is able to stunbreak even when not in hurt state. If below 0, prevents stunbreak)
			- player.mo.temproll (Prevents air dodge. When it reaches zero, the player goes to spring state)
Major gameplay changes
	- Added a brand new Heads-Up Display! It can be reverted to the original HUD via setting the console command battleconfig_hud to "Old"
	- Added new console commands that allow Knuckles and Amy's abilities to aim towards the camera, even during Standard Mode: battleconfig_glidestrafe and battleconfig_hammerstrafe
	- Blockable projectiles can now be blocked with sweetspot defenses
	- Players can latch on to a ledge when holding forward+jump (or automatically with airdodge)
	- Slipstream leniency, range and thrust intensity increased based on other player's speed
	- Dying will permanently decrease the player's starting rings until the next map (This penalty is doubled if in overtime, otherwise, has a limit if provoked by another player)
	- Characters will take twice as long to exhaust in non-survival gametypes
	- Fire trails from elemental shields only damage if the player doesn't have any rings, otherwise, the player loses a ring when in contact with them
	Guard 
		- Guard is once again possible during flashing frames, but will result in a guard break when frame-perfect-parrying this way (for example, if you're standing inside a hazard)
		- Players can no longer guard during heavy bumps (pw_nocontrol + skidtime)
	Air dodge
		- Removed air dodge intantible time penalty from players suffering from flag debuff
		- Doubled air dodge intangible time (0.4s -> 0.8s)
		- Removed movement stasis from air dodge (in fact, severely increased handling/thrustfactor during it)
		- Indicated by HUD timer and lack of after-images, air dodging in the next 5 seconds (configurable with battle_dodgecooldown) will result in:
			- Full stasis
			- Less intangibility time
			- Landing lag
			- Extend your dodge timer even further (An exclamation mark will show up in the HUD timer)
			- If you dodge for a third time while the exclamation mark is up, the landlag will increase and no intangibility will be gained
	Respawn timers
		- Removed respawn time penalty for multiple deaths
		- Respawn timer now increases based on playercount, ranging from 3 to 8 seconds by default
		- Respawn time is now always 5 seconds when spawning as a jetty-syn in survival
		- Respawn time is now always 9 seconds during overtimes
		- Added a rejoin lockout timer when entering spectator mode
	Tumble
		- By default, tumbles can't last longer than 3 seconds. This is lowered to 1 second if the player was in i-frames
		- Massively reduced minimum amount of tumble time required for a stunbreak (66% of the tumble's duration -> 0.2s)
	Invulnerability (power-up)
		- Is no longer affected by B.DoPlayerTumble (it is still affected by parry, as it removes invulnerabilities)
Minor gameplay changes
	- Lower default battle_collisiontimer (12 -> 5)
	- Collisions will no longer occur between players during PreRound
	- Added a 3 frame window (customizable via the console variable battle_coyotetime) where players can still jump from walking off a ledge/slope
	- Added new VFX flair for invulnerability, sneakers, slipstream, guard trigger and stunbreak
	- Players are no longer awarded a force shield in overtime for surviving with 3 lives
	- Players are intangible while spawning
	Stunbreak
		- Applies invulnerability instead of i-frames
		- Player temporarily goes into spin state and restores air dodge
	Jettysyn
		- Lowered shot startup and end lag (0.5s -> 0.33s)
		- Increased normalspeed (12 -> 25)
Character roulette
	- Can now be toggled with TOSSFLAG, or hidden by default with the command battleconfig_roulette
Survival, Team Survival, Arena, Team Arena
	- Added a bounty system where killing the player with highest rank awards the killer with extra rings, score and lifeshards (customizable via the console variable battle_bounty)
		- Additionally, in arena, hitting wanted players will award extra score
	- The highest rank player can always be located with the radar or compass
Battle CTF
	- Flag debuff now also applies a fixed jumpfactor of 100%
	- Holding a flag no longer hinders acceleration and top speed
	- CTF flags can't be touched by players that are in guard, airdodge, or actionstates with atk (example: The falling part of ground pound. Sonic will collect the flag only when landing.)
	- Players cannot lose i-frames when in contact with flags
	- Tossing the flag manually does not apply intangible time to it
	- Flag toss now has a more horizontal angle
	- Audio and visual cue for flag toss

	- Diamond's mechanics have been reworked. Instead of holding the diamond for set duration until you gain points, a control point will spawn around the map as will the Warp topaz. Your goal is to take the warp topaz to the control 	  point to gain your points.
New mode: Ring Rally
	- Team based gametype where both sides collect rings and take them back to a collection sector in their base. This gametype doesn't have a pointlimit and instead is a rush to collect rings until the timer runs out
	- Teams can intercept each others ring collection or even go to each other's bases and steal rings from their base themselves.
New mode: Ruby Run
	- This brand new game mode combines CTF and Ruby gameplay - a Ruby will spawn at the center of the map, and each team must try to bring the ruby to the enemy base!
	- Added support for Ruby Run to all vanilla CTF maps.
Sonic
	Speed Thok
		- Speed increased (45frac -> 50frac)
		- Thok will now always use the highest speed available (player's current speed or actionspd)
			- Player's current speed also accounts for vertical speed, meaning Sonic can build speed by thok-ing when rising from his jump or a monitor bounce
			- Maximum speed of actionspd times 2
			- Different vfx and sfx if the player's current speed was higher than actionspd
	Super Spin Jump

	Flight Dash
		- Increased cooldown (1.4s -> 2s)
		- Decreased attack (1 -> 0)

		- Can be cancelled by pressing the guard button
			- If the player he collided with was an enemy, that player cannot escape the carry, but can stunbreak immediately for 35 rings initially
			- Every time the enemy tries to jump away, the stunbreak cost will decrease by 5, but if they are thrown, it will increase back by 15
			- The stunbreak cost will always have a minimum of 0 rings and a maximum of 35 rings
